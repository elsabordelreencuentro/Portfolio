There's nothing quite like a good-old-fashioned road trip. When you live in the Midwest, these seem to be pretty common. One destination I had never visited was Nashville, Tennessee. It's always been "that would be awesome to visit!" or "maybe I'll go next year". My girlfriend (Jordyn) and I finally decided to go for it and made the short 10-hour drive down to Nashville. 

### Friday
The better part of Friday was consumed by the drive from Des Moines to Nashville. We tried to minimize the number of stops but ended up taking a quick break in St. Louis. Overall, the drive was pretty simple and we managed not to get lost (thanks, GPS). We rolled into Nashville fairly late Friday night and got settled into our Airbnb where we would stay for the duration of the weekend. This quaint, modern-looking condo was just a short drive from downtown and saved us a ton of money on lodging. 

### Saturday
I'll admit we attempted to wake up early but fell into a vacation spell as we hit snooze a couple extra times. Our game plan for the morning was to find a place for brunch. The previous guests of the Airbnb had all contributed to a journal containing helpful tips and suggestions for things to do and places to eat. This lead us to our first stop - [Biscuit Love](http://biscuitlove.com/). 

We first attempted to eat at the main location in The Gulch district but were absolutely blown away by the line of people strung out the door. It had over an hour wait. Luckily they had opened another location in a different district that was still close, so we headed that direction hoping for smaller crowds. We were able to get seated within 20 minutes and were served shortly after. Our appetizer - called "bonuts" - were delectable glazed bite-size donuts. Jordyn and I joked we would come back to Nashville just for these. I had a ham, egg, and bacon biscuit while Jordyn had a sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. We had to get their homemade biscuits, right? Overall we would give it a 9/10 - worth the wait.

Our next stop was for dessert at [Jeni's Ice Cream](https://jenis.com/), which was another restaurant we'd heard great things about. You'll notice a common theme in this blog - we really like food. Trying new restaurants is hands-down my favorite part about traveling. Jordyn had a combination of the flavors "moonshot" and vanilla with a cereal cream homemade waffle cone. I'm not much of a cone person, so I opted for their "creamiest chocolate" along with vanilla in a bowl. I demand a Jeni's Ice Cream for Des Moines. Someone make this happen.

During the day we drove around the different neighborhoods and explored the city. In my head, I had pictured Nashville to be a lot larger than it really was. In reality, it felt a lot more Des Moines sized to me (except with a completely different culture). One of our first stops was [Centennial Park](https://www.nashville.gov/Parks-and-Recreation/Parks/Centennial-Park.aspx). It seemed like you couldn't go a couple blocks without hearing live music in Nashville. We relaxed and listened to music in the park and enjoyed the blissful, sunny weather. Being a wannabe-musician myself, I really appreciated the live music.

One of Jordyn's friends who had previously lived in Nashville told us we *needed* to eat at [Bartaco](https://bartaco.com/). If I had to choose my favorite style of food it would be Mexican, so this was a perfect fit - authentic style Mexican with homemade margaritas. We started to notice that all the popular restaurants in Nashville always had a wait. We waited over an hour just to get a seat, and probably another 20 minutes for our food. Like every other restaurant here though, it was so worth it. We got an arrangement of street tacos: portabello mushroom with queso, pork belly, sesame ribeye, and grilled chicken. I didn't know what to expect with the mushroom tacos but they blew me away. The flavor of the pork belly tacos is making my mouth water just reminiscing while writing this blog. Along with our tacos, we had some grilled corn off the cob which was also excellent. I'm normally a blended margarita kinda guy (I know, I know) but their rocks margaritas were to die for. 

That night we ventured down to [Broadway](http://www.visitmusiccity.com/visitors/honkytonkhighway), the main area for nightlife in downtown Nashville. This is where Nashville started to feel like a big city. It was pretty wild, to say the least, with people running around everywhere and live music bursting out of every bar. We settled on a rooftop bar called [Nudie's Honky Tonk](https://www.nudieshonkytonk.com/). The view from the top was impeccable. As we sipped our expensive drinks (missing Des Moines prices) we enjoyed the moment and agreed this road trip was a superb decision. 


### Sunday
While waiting in line for brunch on Saturday, we had noticed another restaurant close by called the [Pancake Pantry](http://www.thepancakepantry.com/). They advertised 23 different types of pancakes. This didn't really matter to us though because we knew we wanted chocolate chip pancakes. No parents, no rules! We braced ourselves for another hour-long wait as we stood outside in line, staring through the windows and watching others feast. We decided to split our order - over easy eggs, bacon, hash browns, sourdough toast, and Swiss chocolate chip pancakes. We arguably liked this restaurant better than Biscuit Love because it was more of a traditional breakfast joint. 

After finishing eating and entering a slight food coma, we hopped back in the car and headed over to [Radnor Lake State Park](http://tnstateparks.com/parks/about/radnor-lake). We weren't really as prepared as we had thought when we saw the hiking trails. Ultimately, we ended up perched by the water and proceeded to enjoy the peace and quiet. 

For lunch, we drove back into town to a joint called Double Dogs üê∂. I'm a big fan of BBQ and I knew it would be hard to top Jethro's dry rub boneless wings. I decided on the honey chipotle boneless wings with a honey mustard and BBQ mixed sauce. I gotta say - they gave Jethros a run for their money. We sipped on some Summer Shandies, snacked on delicious loaded nachos out of dog bowl, and watched football on the big screen. 

Guess what was next door? Our favorite dessert spot - Jeni's Ice Cream. This time I opted for a mix of peanut butter bristle and Reese's cup, while Jordyn was satisfied with the same moonshot cone. We could have probably stayed here all day and been content. 

As the day rolled on, we headed back downtown and stopped so I could fly my drone. I flew up and over the Titan's stadium and around the outskirts of downtown before bringing it back down safely. Check out the video at the end of the article to see the shots! After that, we headed to a rooftop bar on top of a hotel in The Gulch district called [LA Jackson](http://www.lajacksonbar.com/). We sat back and enjoyed a colorful cotton candy sunset as we drank an East Nash honey wheat beer and a fruity old-fashioned styled mixed drink. As our weekend getaway came to an end, we vowed to come back to Nashville and spend another weekend trying new restaurants and maybe, just maybe, getting some more ice cream from Jeni's.
