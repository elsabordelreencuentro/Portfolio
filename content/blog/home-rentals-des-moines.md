Never underestimate the power of a cold email. That's where this story begins as I reflect on that short but sweet email I sent to Rob a few months ago. 

### Meet Rob

Rob Kincaid owns a website called Home Rentals Des Moines. He's a real estate investor, entreprenuer, and also happens to own my neighboring unit. While searching for a condo to purchase, I stumbled upon Rob's website trying to learn more about [The Plaza](http://www.theplazadsm.com) which I would eventually choose to live in. This website contains of a variety of condos for rent at The Plaza, as well as some homes for rent in the South of Grand neighborhood. At the time, I didn't realize that Rob owned all of these units. 

Being a web developer, I naturally examine and dissect every web page I visit. I mentally take note of the things I like and dislike. I immediately noticed that the site needed a visual overhaul. Rob had contracted a devloper to put Home Rentals Des Moines together a few years back, but since then hadn't made any updates. It was working as intended and served his needs. What he lacked was the vision for what it *could* look like. That's what I came in. I sent Rob a cold email letting him know I just moved into The Plaza and offered my services to him. Long story short, he took me up on that offer.

### The Website

The website is hosted on Rob's server, which contains a few other websites he owns and maintains. It was built with HTML, CSS, and PHP. It was designed with a CMS (Content Management System) so that Rob can add, remove, and update listings. The listing information is stored in a SQL database. 

One key thing to note is that the website did not utilize any third party frameworks for it's visual design (e.g. Bootstrap). It did use a small JavaScript framework to display images and the Google Maps JavaScript framework. The previous developer had included all the CSS inside the HTML files - eww.
