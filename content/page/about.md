![Lee Robinson](/img/reinebringen.jpg)

I'm a 24-year-old programmer currently thriving in downtown Des Moines, IA. I'm a proud alum of Iowa State University where I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. When I'm not at Workiva, I work as a freelance photographer/videographer. I'm also what some would call a "music nerd" and enjoy playing a variety of instruments and rocking the occasional karaoke session.

For a closer look at the professional work I've done, check out my [resume](/LeeRobinson.pdf). If you're interested in reaching out to me, feel free to [contact me](mailto:lrobinson2011@gmail.com). Cheers!
